# Python Data Science Project

Welcome to my Python data science project repository! This project focuses on leveraging Python libraries for data analysis to answer seven questions.

## Overview

In this project, I explore one dataset using Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas. My goal is to share knowlegde with the community.

## What did I do? 

Here are some answers that I based on for this project.
It's important to know that you can do it by yourself, in case you get lost, this repository is here to help you.

#### 1. Get only the legendary grass-type Pokémon.
#### 2. Get the Pokémon with the highest HP.
#### 3. Get the Pokémon with more than 80 Sp. Atk and less than 120 Sp. Atk.
#### 4. Get the Pokémon generation with the highest number of Pokémon.
#### 5. Get the Pokémon with only one type, how many Pokémon are there, and what is the average between types.
#### 6. Get the Pokémon that start with "J".
#### 7. Get the most common type of Pokémon
   
## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply clone the repository or create a new project and explore the database with Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook corresponds to one of the questions explored above, along with explanations and code snippets.

## Requirements

#### 1. Python 3 (You can easily install python with the [original documentation](https://www.python.org/))
#### 2. Jupyter Notebook (simply change the archive extension to .ipynb or run it on websites such as Colaboratory.
#### 3 .Pandas (you need to run this code on the cmd: pip install pandas )
